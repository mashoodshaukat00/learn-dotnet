**Exercises :** 

1. Write a method that checks if given number (positive integer) contains digit 3. Do not convert number to other type. Do not use built-in functions like `Contains(), StartsWith()`, etc.

   Expected input and output

   ```csharp
   IfNumberContains3(7201432) → true
   IfNumberContains3(87501) → false
   ```

   

2. Given a year as integer, write a method that checks if year is leap.

   Expected input and output

```csharp
   IfYearIsLeap(2016) → true
   IfYearIsLeap(2018) → false
```

3. Given three numbers, write a method that adds two first ones and multiplies them by a third one.

    Expected input and output

```csharp
 AddAndMultiply(2, 4, 5) → 30
```

4. Given a string, write a method that checks if it is a palindrome (is read the same backward as forward). Assume that string may consist only of lower-case letters.

   Expected input and output

   ```csharp
   IsPalindrome("eye") → true 
   IsPalindrome("home") → false
   ```

   

5. TBD (will add more)
